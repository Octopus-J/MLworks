# MLworks
Some small codes about ML,implemented in python3

# Hello!Thanks for your reading

These codes were created to solve the work of Andrew Ng's Mechine learning course (In Coursa).

I upload these codes to share and help other people who is learning this course.

I know that there are a lot of problems both in codes and english, and many parts could be improved,if you want to improve it,just do it.

I hope the annotations are sufficiently detailed, thank you for your reading.
