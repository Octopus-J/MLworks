    These codes were writen by ZJ, and they were created to solve the work of Andrew Ng's Mechine learning course (In Coursa).
    I upload these codes to share and help other people who is learning this course.
    I know that there are a lot of problems both in codes and english, and many parts could be improved,if you want to improve it,just do it.
    I hope the annotations are sufficiently detailed, thank you for your reading.
